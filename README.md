# ReSizer
A simple GUI based desktop tool for resizing images, It can be used for to resize the Logo/App Icon for various mobile versions or resize a generic image to a particular size without loosing the quality of the image
This tool is inspired by [DownSize](https://github.com/ChaseFlorell/Downsize) infact I am using it's logging and image convertion code, So kind of a new updated version of DownSize. 

###Contributing###

Altough I have tried to make this tool simple and easy to use but it might be missing feature X, or platform Y. If you want something that it can't currently provide, I love pull requests. If it's a bigger change, you can also create new tool using this code like I did with this tool.
